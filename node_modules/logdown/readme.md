Logdown is a debug utility for the browser and the server with Markdown support.
It does not have any dependencies and is only 2K gzipped.

You can see it in action in the [example page](//caiogondim.github.io/logdown)
or in the preview below.

## Using

The simplest use of the library in both platforms could be done as follow.

```js
// In the server-side or client-side with Browserify
var Logdown = require('logdown')
var debug = new Logdown({prefix: 'foo'})
```

```js
// In the browser
var debug = new Logdown({prefix: 'foo'})
```
It is highly recommended to use a prefix for your instance, this way you get
a nice prefixed message on console and it is possible to silence instances
based on the prefix name, as we will see after.

After creating your object, you can use the regular `log`, `warn`, `info` and
`error` methods as we have on `console`, but now with Markdown support.

```js
debug.log('lorem *ipsum*')
debug.info('dolor _sit_ amet')
debug.warn('consectetur `adipiscing` elit')
```


### New objects

The constructor accepts one object for configuration on instantiation time.

#### `opts.prefix`

Type: 'String'

Default: `''`

```js
var debug = new Logdown({prefix: 'foo'})
debug.log('Lorem ipsum') // Will use console.log with a prefix
```

You should use the name of your module.
You can, also, use `:` to separate modules inside one big module.

```js
var bar = new Logdown({prefix: 'foo:bar'})
bar.log('Lorem ipsum')

var quz = new Logdown({prefix: 'foo:quz'})
quz.log('Lorem Ipsum')
```

#### `opts.markdown`

Type: 'Boolean'

Default: `true`

If setted to `false`, markdown will not be parsed.

```js
var bar = new Logdown({markdown: false})
bar.log('Lorem *ipsum*') // Will not parse the markdown
```

For Markdown, the following mark-up is supported:

```js
// Bold with "*"" between words
debug.log('lorem *ipsum*')

// Italic with "_" between words
debug.log('lorem _ipsum_')

// Code with ` (backtick) between words
debug.log('lorem `ipsum`')
```


## Enabling/disabling instances

It is possible to enable/disable the output of instances using the
`Logdown.disable` or `Logdown.enable` methods.

```js
Logdown.disable('foo') // will disable the instance with *foo* prefix
Logdown.enable('bar') // will enable the instance with *bar* prefix
```

You can also use wildcards.

```js
Logdown.enable('*') // enables all instances
Logdown.diable('*') // disables all instances
Logdown.enable('foo*') // enables all instances with a prefix starting with *foo*
```

Use `-` to do a negation.

```js
// enables all instances but the one with *foo* prefix
Logdown.enable('*', '-foo')
// disables all intances with foo in the prefix, but don't disable *foobar*
Logdown.disable('*foo*', '-foobar')
```
